# Flexmap
Flexmap is a datastructure for k-mer based bioinformatics. Flexmap is a multimap, where multiple values can be stored for a single key. Keys are k-mers of DNA of size 15 or shorter which are stored with all. Additionally with the positions, flexmap stores additional fixed size flanking regions around the k-mer.
